Face Recognition with Face API.js

Description

This JavaScript project leverages the powerful Face API.js library to detect faces in real-time video streams and perform facial recognition. It captures video input, detects faces, compares them to a provided image, and displays a label if a match is found.

Features

-   Real-time face detection using Face API.js
-   Facial recognition against a reference image
-   Labeled output indicating recognized faces

Getting Started

1.  Prerequisites
    -   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from <https://nodejs.org/en>.
2.  Clone the Repository

    Bash

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/moizshabbir/faceapi_face_recognition.git

    ```

3.  Install Dependencies

    Bash

    ```
    cd faceapi_face_recognition
    npm install -g light-server (or yarn install -g light-server)

    ```

Usage

1.  Run the Application

    Bash

    ```
    light-server -s . -p 7000

    ```

    This will start the application and display the video stream with face detection and recognition functionality.
2.  Reference Image
    -   Place the image you want to use for facial recognition in the project directory (usually alongside the `index.html` file).

How it Works

1.  The application initializes the Face API.js library and loads the reference image.
2.  It continuously captures video frames from the user's webcam using JavaScript's `getUserMedia` API.
3.  For each frame, Face API.js is used to detect faces within the video stream.
4.  The detected faces are compared against the loaded reference image using facial recognition techniques in Face API.js.
5.  If a match is found, a label is displayed on the captured image, indicating the recognized face.

Libraries Used
